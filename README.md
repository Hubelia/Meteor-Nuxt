# Meteor-Nuxt
A wicked experiment attempting combining Meteor and Nuxt for highly modern application development with split
responsibilities.

We use Nuxt for it's excellent SSR capabilities with Vue. Something Meteor really can't do very well.
And we use Meteor for it's awesome DDP client and server.

## Installation
